# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local development

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- An OpenWeather API key

### Setup
1. Create `backend/.env` from `backend/env.example` and set `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`.
2. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm --prefix backend install`

### Run the app
- `npm run dev` starts the React app and backend API together.
- Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:3001`
- The frontend proxies `/api` requests to the backend in development.

### Deploy / production
- Build frontend + backend: `npm run build`
- Start backend (serves the frontend build when `NODE_ENV=production`): `npm start`
- Make sure to set `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in the backend environment.
- If the frontend is hosted separately, set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to your API base URL.
- If the backend serves the frontend build, set `NODE_ENV=production` when starting the backend.

### Deploy to Railway (backend)
- Set the Railway root directory to `backend`.
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Environment variables: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` (required), `PORT` (Railway provides).

### Deploy to Vercel (frontend)
- Set the Vercel root directory to the project root (the folder with `package.json`).
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `build`
- Environment variables: `REACT_APP_API_URL` set to your Railway backend URL (e.g. `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api`).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
